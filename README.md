# Data Cleaning for ML
Data scientists often work with raw data, which can contain repeated, missing, or irrelevant information. Using such data in machine learning analysis can lead to low accuracy or incorrect predictions. Therefore, data cleaning, is a crucial technique that should be performed before building any models.
This notebook explores common data cleaning techniques used by data scientists to prepare their data for analysis. The objectives of this lab include using logarithmic transformations to modify data, handling duplicate entries, managing missing values, standardizing and normalizing data, and addressing outliers.

## Dataset
The Ames_Housing_Data.tsv file, hosted on IBM Cloud object storage, will be used for this analysis. The dataset examines features of houses sold in Ames, Iowa, USA, between 2006 and 2010.
